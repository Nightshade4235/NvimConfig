# NvimConfig
My neovim config


To use this on Linux/MacOS do ```git clone https://github.com/Nightshade4235/NvimConfig ~/.config/nvim``` and ```rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/.git``` to remove the .git folder so you can use this in your own repo later.

To use this on Windows do ```git clone https://github.com/Nightshade4235/NvimConfig $env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim``` and ```Remove-Item $env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim\.git -Recurse -Force``` to remove the .git folder so you can use this in your own repo later.
